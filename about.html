    About Us
    </p>
<p class="text">
    This website was created as part of a school project to support quick learning, easy reference, and practical guidance for students in the field of nursing. Our goal is to reduce information overload and focus on the most commonly used nursing practices and terms.

    Inspiration
    </h1>
<p class="sub-category">
    This project was inspired by my own experiences in skills lab, clinical duties, and academic challenges. I wanted something fast, student-friendly, and simplified â€” something I wish I had when I first started in my chosen program, Bachelor of Science in Nursing.
