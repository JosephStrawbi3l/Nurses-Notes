    ü©∫ Taking Vital Signs
    </h1>
<div class="procedure-section">
  <div class="procedure-text"><p>
    Taking vital signs is essential in assessing a patient's current health status. It involves checking temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation to detect any irregularities. Vital signs should be measured during initial assessment, before and after procedures, and when a patient's condition changes. These measurements help ensure timely care and protect both the patient and healthcare providers.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Temperature:</b> Measure using oral, axillary, tympanic, or rectal route.</li>
    <li><b>Pulse:</b> Assess rate, rhythm, and strength.</li>
    <li><b>Respiration:</b> Observe breathing rate, depth, and rhythm.</li>
    <li><b>Blood Pressure:</b> Use a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope.</li>
    <li><b>Oxygen Saturation:</b> Use a pulse oximeter on the fingertip.</li>
    </ul>
